## tail

Truncate dataset to its last rows.

### Usage

    tail [-n COUNT]/?urlâ€¦

    -n COUNT
        Number of rows to truncate to. If this option is
        omitted, it defaults to 10.

        A leading + sign means this number is relative to
        the first row. Otherwise it is relative to the last
        row.

### Examples
